### Teri Chadbourne
#### Web Developer | Developer Advocate


I'm a front-end web developer, developer advocate, and open-source project maintainer
with a passion for education and events. As lead maintainer and developer of
<a href="https://proto.school" target="_blank">ProtoSchool</a>,
I build interactive coding tutorials on decentralized web protocols and nurture
the growth of learning communities around the globe.

I'm proud to co-organize <a href="http://offlinefirst.org/camp" target="_blank">
Offline Camp</a>, an unconference tech retreat that's building the
<a href="http://offlinefirst.org/" target="_blank">Offline First</a> community, one
campfire at a time.

In past developer advocacy roles, I've helped my fellow coders
succeed by creating beginner-friendly blog
posts, tutorials, talks, and code
samples on topics including Offline First,  Progressive Web Apps, and the Decentralized Web.
