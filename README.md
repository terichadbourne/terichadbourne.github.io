#### Web Developer | Developer Advocate
##### Crafting developer communities through events

I'm a full-stack web developer and developer advocate with a passion for crafting developer communities through events. I'm proud to co-organize [Offline Camp](http://offlinefirst.org/camp), an unconference tech retreat that's building the [Offline First](http://offlinefirst.org/) community, one campfire at a time. As a developer advocate, I help my fellow coders succeed by creating beginner-friendly blog posts, tutorials, talks, and code samples on topics including Offline First and Progressive Web Apps.
