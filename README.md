##### Crafting developer communities through events

I'm a full-stack web developer and developer advocate with a passion for crafting developer communities through events. I'm proud to co-organize Offline Camp, an unconference tech retreat that's building the Offline First community, one campfire at a time. As a developer advocate, I help my fellow coders succeed by creating beginner-friendly blog posts, tutorials, talks, and code samples on topics including Offline First and Progressive Web Apps.
